# Business-Development-of-Kickstarter-fundraising-platform
This project was commissioned to examine the data on past Kickstarter projects and recommend ways to increase the chances of putting up a successful project by project owners, maximize the revenue obtained by the Kickstarter platform and provide insightful suggestions to backers looking to fund projects. Based on various analysis that were done, few key insights are summarized as shown below. 1. It was evident that extending the pledge period for the projects by a single day lead to an increase in revenue of approximately $1400 for the platform 2. Successful projects had lesser goal amounts and shorter pledge periods compared to other categories of projects such as failed and canceled projects 3. The category “Chiptune” had the highest number of average backers despite its low count of a mere 35 projects
